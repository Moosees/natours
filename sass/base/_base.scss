// Browser reset without normalize.css, the * marker does not include pseudo elements, so we add those as well
*,
*::after,
*::before {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    box-sizing: inherit; // use inherited box-sizing as default for all elements, without this line box-sizing is not inherited
}

html {
    font-size: 62.5%; // sets root font size to a easy to handle value for use with rems, 62.5% is equial to 10px if user settings is 16px (most common)
}

// everything on body is inherited by children, better practise to use inheritance than apply on everything
body {
    box-sizing: border-box; // border-box makes borders and padding not add to the total size of elements, body box-sizing sets the default method to use
}
